This repository contains sample projects for a basics in python course at Eastalke High School's SATA program.
Below is a description of the projects and what lessons are covered with those projects.

## 1. ALPHABET PROJECT

### Prroblem

Fonts for the text based output of python are bland and boring


### Solution

Create a program that takes text as input and outputs the text using "fancy" lettering stored in a file.


### Files in the Project

 -Alphabet.txt - contains the alphabet in a "Fancy" way
 
 -RunFancy.py - is the file to run. To run with a different alphabet, update the LETTER_HEIGHT variable. 
  
  
### Future Improvements
  
 -Add a GUI
    
 -Make output to a file
